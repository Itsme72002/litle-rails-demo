<h4>Authorization</h4>
<p>The Authorization transaction enables you to confirm that a customer has submitted a valid payment method with their order and has sufficient funds to purchase the goods or services they ordered.</p>
<%= link_to 'New Auth', new_order_path %>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Capture</h4>
<p>The Capture transaction transfers funds from the customer to the merchant. The Capture references the associated Authorization by means of the litleTxnId element returned in the Authorization response.</p>
<%= link_to 'New Capture', new_capture_path %>
</section>
<h4>Credit/Refund</h4>
<p>The Credit/Refund transaction enables you to refund money to a customer, even if the original transaction occurred outside of the Litle & Co. system.</p>
<%= link_to 'New Credit', new_credit_path %>
<h4>Purchase</h4>
<p>The Purchase transaction enables you to both authorize fund availability and deposit those funds by means of a single transaction. The Sale transaction is also known as a conditional deposit, because the deposit takes place only if the authorization succeeds. If the authorization is declined, the deposit will not be processed.</p>
