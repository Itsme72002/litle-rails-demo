In this Demo Rails (v3.1.1) App, we test 6 Litle_Online payment methods.
Authorization
AuthReversal
Capture
Credit
Sale
Void
All the payment methods have explanation with it.
NOTICE: In Capture, we set the reportgroup, ordersource as defult value with "Planets", "ecommerce".
	In Credit, we set the ordersource as defult value with "ecmmerce"
	All this defult value was set cause easy to test.
	You can check the full input using Sale or Auth.
